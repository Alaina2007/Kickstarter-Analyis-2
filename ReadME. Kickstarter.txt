# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Analyze how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and fundraiser goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date, I created a pivot table with months (rows) and outcomes (headers) and filtered by parent caterogy "theater".

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal, I created a pivot table and chart by goal ranges and outcomes. Data for range outcomes established by using "COUNTIFS" for each range. 

### Challenges and difficulties encountered were using the "COUNTIFS" function as I forgot to change criteria for outcome types and add quotations.

## Results

- Outcomes based on launch dates reveals that May and June are the best months to launch. Also, failed rates are less than half during the months of May and June in comparison to successful rates.

- Outcomes based on Goals concludes that fundraisers with goals less than or equal to  $4,999 are most successful with a success rate over 70%. Goals greather than are equal to $45,000 have the least successful rate.

- The theater category limits the dataset as this parent category could be narrowed to a more specific search yielding a more accurate analysis

- Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create are Outcomes based on Pledged Amount and Outcomes based on Time Frame (Launch Date and Deadline)
